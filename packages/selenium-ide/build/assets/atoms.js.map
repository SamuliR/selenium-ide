New code\n * should construct goog.html types via their APIs, template systems or\n * sanitizers. If that’s not possible it should use\n * goog.html.uncheckedconversions and undergo security review.\n\n *\n * The semantics of the conversions in goog.html.legacyconversions are very\n * different from the ones provided by goog.html.uncheckedconversions. The\n * latter are for use in code where it has been established through manual\n * security review that the value produced by a piece of code will always\n * satisfy the SafeHtml contract (e.g., the output of a secure HTML sanitizer).\n * In uses of goog.html.legacyconversions, this guarantee is not given -- the\n * value in question originates in unreviewed legacy code and there is no\n * guarantee that it satisfies the SafeHtml contract.\n *\n * There are only three valid uses of legacyconversions:\n *\n * 1. Introducing a goog.html version of a function which currently consumes\n * string and passes that string to a DOM API which can execute script - and\n * hence cause XSS - like innerHTML. For example, Dialog might expose a\n * setContent method which takes a string and sets the innerHTML property of\n * an element with it. In this case a setSafeHtmlContent function could be\n * added, consuming goog.html.SafeHtml instead of string, and using\n * goog.dom.safe.setInnerHtml instead of directly setting innerHTML.\n * setContent could then internally use legacyconversions to create a SafeHtml\n * from string and pass the SafeHtml to setSafeHtmlContent. In this scenario\n * remember to document the use of legacyconversions in the modified setContent\n * and consider deprecating it as well.\n *\n * 2. Automated refactoring of application code which handles HTML as string\n * but needs to call a function which only takes goog.html types. For example,\n * in the Dialog scenario from (1) an alternative option would be to refactor\n * setContent to accept goog.html.SafeHtml instead of string and then refactor\n * all current callers to use legacyconversions to pass SafeHtml. This is\n * generally preferable to (1) because it keeps the library clean of\n * legacyconversions, and makes code sites in application code that are\n * potentially vulnerable to XSS more apparent.\n *\n * 3. Old code which needs to call APIs which consume goog.html types and for\n * which it is prohibitively expensive to refactor to use goog.html types.\n * Generally, this is code where safety from XSS is either hopeless or\n * unimportant.\n *\n * @visibility {//closure/goog/html:approved_for_legacy_conversion}\n * @visibility {//closure/goog/bin/sizetests:__pkg__}\n */\n\n\n\n\ngoog.html.SafeHtml=require(\"./safehtml.js\").goog.html.SafeHtml;\ngoog.html.SafeStyle=require(\"./safestyle.js\").goog.html.SafeStyle;\ngoog.html.SafeStyleSheet=require(\"./safestylesheet.js\").goog.html.SafeStyleSheet;\ngoog.html.SafeUrl=require(\"./safeurl.js\").goog.html.SafeUrl;\ngoog.html.TrustedResourceUrl=require(\"./trustedresourceurl.js\").goog.html.TrustedResourceUrl;\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to SafeHtml for legacy API\n * purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} html A string to be converted to SafeHtml.\n * @return {!goog.html.SafeHtml} The value of html, wrapped in a SafeHtml\n *     object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.safeHtmlFromString = function(html) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.SafeHtml.createSafeHtmlSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(\n      html, null /* dir */);\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to SafeStyle for legacy API\n * purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} style A string to be converted to SafeStyle.\n * @return {!goog.html.SafeStyle} The value of style, wrapped in a SafeStyle\n *     object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.safeStyleFromString = function(style) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.SafeStyle.createSafeStyleSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(\n      style);\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to SafeStyleSheet for legacy\n * API purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} styleSheet A string to be converted to SafeStyleSheet.\n * @return {!goog.html.SafeStyleSheet} The value of style sheet, wrapped in\n *     a SafeStyleSheet object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.safeStyleSheetFromString = function(styleSheet) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.SafeStyleSheet\n      .createSafeStyleSheetSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(styleSheet);\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to SafeUrl for legacy API\n * purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} url A string to be converted to SafeUrl.\n * @return {!goog.html.SafeUrl} The value of url, wrapped in a SafeUrl\n *     object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.safeUrlFromString = function(url) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.SafeUrl.createSafeUrlSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(url);\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to TrustedResourceUrl for\n * legacy API purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} url A string to be converted to TrustedResourceUrl.\n * @return {!goog.html.TrustedResourceUrl} The value of url, wrapped in a\n *     TrustedResourceUrl object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.trustedResourceUrlFromString = function(url) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.TrustedResourceUrl\n      .createTrustedResourceUrlSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(url);\n};\n\n/**\n * @private {function(): undefined}\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_ = goog.nullFunction;\n\n\n/**\n * Sets a function that will be called every time a legacy conversion is\n * performed.
